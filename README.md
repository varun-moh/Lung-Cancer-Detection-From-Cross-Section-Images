# ðŸš€ AI Project

This repository contains a machine learning project that involves training and testing a model using PyTorch.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Model training with PyTorch
- Dataset handling using Kaggle API
- Model evaluation on test dataset

## ðŸ›  Installation
To set up the environment, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision pillow tqdm kaggle
```

## ðŸ“‚ Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model:
```bash
jupyter notebook ai_project.ipynb
```

Ensure that your runtime supports GPU (e.g., T4) for faster training.

## ðŸ“Š Results
The trained model is tested on a dataset, and performance metrics are evaluated.
